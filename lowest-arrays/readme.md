# Prompts
* given this array  [[1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [2, 6, 7]] please find me an array which contains arrays of unique values with each number being used exactly once across all arrays
* please write it to maximize the number of values within each array of the output array
* please rewrite it in javascript with the additional requirement that each array within the output array has at least one value
* Note: I found it interesting that the console.log did not show as it expected. meaning it can't actually test code in this version.
* Result: did a couple more prompts but abandonded it because output was not improving
